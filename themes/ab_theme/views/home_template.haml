      Howdy.  My name is Cody Duval and Abstractly is the home of my programming persona.  Itâ€™s a virtual representation of my world as it relates to the narrow subject of coding and technology.  And itâ€™s called Abstractly because, in the end, programming is really just about solving problems in a general (that is, abstract) way.
    %p
      I started teaching myself to code in the fall of 2011.  While I've always been somewhat technical, it wasn't until recently that I began pursuing programming as a more serious hobby.  I'm currently focused on learning Ruby on Rails and jQuery.
    %p
      On this page you'll find some information about the projects I'm working on, an admittedly subjective assessment of my technical skills, and some resources if you arrived here with a similar to learn to code.

            %p
            Broker Bot automates the tedious (and unreliable) task of keeping track of communication between a real estate agent and his clients.  A copy of every email sent between broker and client is sent to the app, where it scans the email body for URLs referring to real estate listings.  If found, the app creates an entry for the new listing and pulls (scrapes) relevant data about the listing from the referring real estate website.

              Physically mailed postcards are still an incredibly effictive way to communicate.  The Card-er-ator allows anyone to compose and mail a physical postcard from their mobile phone or browswer. After users select their card design and compose their message, a third party service prints and mails the card for a nominal fee.  Screenshots to come as the app is currently in development.

            My liberal arts degree and career in advertising & marketing means I have a well developed set of "soft" skills.  On the technical side, I'm mostly self-taught.  Mouse over any particular skill for more detail.

          My first exposure to a programming language was in elementary school (er, back in a decade that rhymes with "ladies"), where I used LOGO to create elaborate turtle art on green-monochrome Apple IIe's and Commodore 64s ('Load "*", 8, 1' anyone?).
        %p
          Later, high school brought with it PCs, 9600 baud modems, BBSes, and Pascal.  A liberal arts degree and career in advertising meant I largely missed Visual Basic, Java, and PHP, and it wasn't until 2010 that I opened up a text editor and taught myself HTML & CSS.

          In the fall of 2011, I took General Assembly's 10-week Front End Web Developent Course.  I've since recommended the course to others and I think it's an amazing way to get up-to-speed on HTML, CSS, and Javascript in a relatively short amount of time.
        %p
          Finally, in February of 2012 I enrolled in Avi Flombaum's' 8-week Ruby on Rails intensive.  This, along with Michael Hartl's online tutorial, was enough to get me off the ground and building (simple) web apps.
        %p
          Since then, I've been working on a handful of personal projects (see above), and, as Jesse Farmer of Dev Bootcamp says, I try hard to
