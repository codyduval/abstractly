This is the source code for my old Nesta-powered blog and home site.  [Nesta](https://github.com/gma/nesta) is an open-source static site generator built by Graham Ashton.  I chose to build my site on-top of Nesta [after comparing it to Octopress](http://abstract.ly/blog/octopress-vs-nesta).  Octopress is great too; it was just a hair too complex for my needs.  And I really like how Nesta sits on top of Sinatra.
